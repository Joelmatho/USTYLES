# TheUselessWeb: Styled

## Description
We've made some significant updates to the website to enhance the user experience. One of the most noticeable changes is the addition of a dark mode, which provides an alternative color scheme that can be easier on the eyes and more energy-efficient. We also removed the scrollbar to create a smoother and more immersive browsing experience, eliminating distractions and enhancing the focus on content. These updates are designed to create a more comfortable and engaging experience for visitors, whether they prefer light or dark modes
