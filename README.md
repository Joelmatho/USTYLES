# My Stylus Userstyles Repository

Welcome to my collection of userstyles for the Stylus browser extension! My name is Joel, and I created this repository to share my custom CSS styles for various websites that I frequent or use. As a web design hobbyist, I enjoy creating userstyles that enhance the visual appeal, readability, and functionality of different types of websites.

In this repository, you will find a variety of userstyles that I personally designed and tested on websites that span different domains and genres. Some examples of my userstyles include:

Simplified styles that remove clutter and improve readability for text-heavy websites or forums
Personalized themes that showcase my favorite colors or interests
Unique styles that experiment with layout or typography
In addition to my own styles, I also welcome contributions from other Stylus users who share my passion for web design and customization. Whether you want to add a new style, modify an existing one, or report an issue, you can fork this repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request. Please check out my contribution guidelines for more details.

To use any of the userstyles in this repository, you will need to have Stylus installed in your browser and create a new style based on the CSS code in the corresponding file. Each userstyle file contains a header with metadata, such as the name, author, and description of the style, as well as a CSS code block that you can copy and paste into a new Stylus style.

I hope that my userstyles will inspire you to customize your browsing experience and make the web a more enjoyable and accessible place for you. If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, feel free to contact me or open an issue. Happy styling!
