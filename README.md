Welcome to my collection of userstyles for the Stylus browser extension! My name is [Your Name], and as a web design hobbyist, I've created this repository to share my custom CSS styles for various websites that I frequent or use.

In this repository, you will find a variety of userstyles that I've personally designed and tested. My styles are aimed at enhancing the visual appeal, readability, and functionality of different types of websites, and include:

- Simplified styles that remove clutter and improve readability for text-heavy websites or forums
- Personalized themes that showcase my favorite colors or interests
- Unique styles that experiment with layout or typography

I'm always looking to expand my collection and welcome contributions from other Stylus users who share my passion for web design and customization. If you're interested in adding a new style, modifying an existing one, or reporting an issue, please check out my [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) and feel free to submit a pull request.

To use any of the userstyles in this repository, you will need to have Stylus installed in your browser and create a new style based on the CSS code in the corresponding file. Each userstyle file contains a header with metadata, such as the name, author, and description of the style, as well as a CSS code block that you can copy and paste into a new Stylus style.

I'm particularly interested in creating styles for gaming websites and related content, so you can expect to find styles that cater to that niche. However, my repository is not limited to gaming - I'm open to creating styles for a wide range of websites and content, and I encourage you to submit your own styles as well!

If you have any feedback, suggestions, or questions, feel free to contact me or open an issue. I hope my userstyles will inspire you to customize your browsing experience and make the web a more enjoyable and accessible place for you. Happy styling!
