## Response Time

We will make our best effort to respond to security vulnerability reports in a timely manner, and to provide updates as the investigation and remediation progresses. However, please note that our response time may vary depending on the complexity and severity of the reported vulnerability.

## Disclosure Policy

We will not disclose the identity of the reporter without their consent, unless required by law. We also ask that reporters do not disclose the vulnerability to others until we have had an opportunity to investigate and address the issue.
